# Spider_Crawler
Read Python 3.10 Requirements thing.
<br>I updated the UI.
<br>I don't know what the checkboxes do, and I haven't implemented the Relevence filter combobox- the rest is functional. The search class and everything basically still applies, and the code uses searchtype0 and searchtype1 as methods (not 2,3,4). The info section is basically one long string right
now, so take that as you will. There's probably other stuff but I forgot.
